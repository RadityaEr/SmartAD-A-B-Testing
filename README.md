# A/B Testing: SmartAd vs. Normal Ad
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of using SmartAd instead of a Normal Ad on user engagement and conversion rates. The goal is to determine whether SmartAd leads to statistically significant improvements in key performance metrics.

## Problem Statement
Companies invest heavily in online advertising, but does using an intelligent ad system (SmartAd) result in better engagement and conversions than a traditional Normal Ad? This A/B test aims to answer that question using statistical analysis.

## Methodology
Experiment Design

Users are randomly assigned to either the SmartAd (treatment) or Normal Ad (control) group.

Key metrics: conversion rate.

Data Cleaning & Exploration

Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Summarizing key statistics for both groups.

## Statistical Testing

Hypothesis Testing:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): SmartAd has no significant effect compared to Normal Ad.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): SmartAd leads to a significant improvement.

Tests Used:

T-test for comparing means (CTR, revenue).

Chi-square test for categorical outcomes (conversion rates).

Effect size calculation to measure practical significance.

Results & Insights 
- Interpretation of statistical test results.
- Business recommendations based on findings.
